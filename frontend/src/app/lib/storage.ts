    content: `<p>The WebAssembly specification has officially added garbage collection support, a highly anticipated feature that will enable more efficient ports of languages like Java, C#, and Python to the web.</p>
    
    <p>Previously, languages with garbage collection had to ship their own GC implementation, adding significant overhead. The new WasmGC proposal allows these languages to integrate with the browser's existing garbage collector.</p>
    
    <p>This development is expected to accelerate WebAssembly adoption and enable new classes of applications to run efficiently in the browser.</p>`,
